##### ASSIGNMENT STARTS HERE #####

'''
Because these are variables, we can modify their values!

Please enter in whatever values you'd like to display. 

What does it output?

They can be real or fake, it does not matter!

That said - what happens when you input the same values?

ASSIGNMENT GOAL:
- Make "Variable Manipulation" cell output types match first cell


'''

name = input("Jamie")
age = int(input(20))
height = float(input(6))
is_student = bool(input(True))

# I'm assuming this should be working, I cannot find anything wrong with it, and I am very confused

displayValues(name,age,height,is_student)

##### ASSIGNMENT ENDS HERE #####


#%%
# Run this cell when you're ready to check your data!
message = dataCheck(name,age,height,is_student)

if message == None:
    print('Data types check out - well done!')
    print('Assignment Complete')

else:
    print(message)
